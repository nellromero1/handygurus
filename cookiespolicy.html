        Handy Guru’s website is basically informational with no data collected for transactional 
        processing.  Our website allows our customers and prospects to learn about the services we offer.  
        On our To Contact US page, we may collect certain personally identifiable information and during a 
        chat conversation (initiated within our website) we preserve the logs of the chat exchanges 
        between prospects, customers, potential employees, etc.  In general, any individual can visit our 
        website without revealing any personally identifiable information but as this information is 
        revealed we take the appropriate provisions to protect it. 

        <br><br>
        Typically, when by visiting a website, IP addresses are collected and logged as part of the process; 
        however, we do not link any IP addresses to any personally identifiable information, therefore our 
        visitors will remain anonymous to us unless they initiate a chat session.

You can find instructions for managing cookie controls on websites for browsers within the Settings/Internet Options areas for Microsoft 
        Internet Explorer browsers, Apple Safari browsers, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox browsers.

               Federal “Do Not Call” laws allow you to place your phone numbers on the National Do Not Call

                Most telemarketing laws allow companies to contact their own customers without consulting the
